# OwlSQL

> Write raw SQL. Get fully-typed results. No codegen, no ORM, no runtime parsing.

OwlSQL (`@owlsql/core`) reads your SQL **inside TypeScript's type system** and
infers the row shape directly from the query string and your schema. The query
`'select id, name from users'` becomes `{ id: number; name: string }[]` — at
edit time, in your IDE, with zero build step.

```ts
const result = await db.query('select id, name from users');

if (result.status === ResultStatus.Ok) {
  result.value;
  //     ^? { id: number; name: string }[]
}
```

## What it does

You give it two things:

1. A **schema** — a TypeScript type mapping each table to its columns and their
   types.
2. A **SQL query** — written as a plain string literal.

It gives you back the **exact result type**, computed by the compiler from the
text of the query:

```ts
type DB = {
  users: { id: number; name: string; email: string; active: boolean };
};

const a = await db.query('select id from users');
//        a.value ^? { id: number }[]

const b = await db.query('select name as handle, active from users');
//        b.value ^? { handle: string; active: boolean }[]

const c = await db.query('select * from users');
//        c.value ^? { id: number; name: string; email: string; active: boolean }[]
```

Rename a column in the SQL, mistype a field, or select something that does not
exist, and the result type changes immediately — before you run a single line.
There is **no generated file to keep in sync** and **no SQL parser shipped to
production**: all the work happens during type checking.

It is **not** an ORM and **not** a query builder. It does not connect to your
database. You keep writing the SQL you already know; this library only layers
compile-time result typing on top of whatever driver you use.

## Why I built it

I was building a TypeScript backend and deliberately chose **raw SQL** over an
ORM — I wanted full control over the queries, predictable performance, and no
magic between my code and the database. That part worked great.

The pain was the **return types**. Every query handed me back `any[]` (or
`unknown[]`), so I hand-wrote an interface for each result:

```ts
interface UserListRow { id: number; name: string }
const rows = (await pool.query('select id, name from users')).rows as UserListRow[];
```

Two problems showed up fast:

1. **They drift.** Someone edits the SQL to also select `email`, but forgets the
   interface. Now the type lies, and the bug only surfaces at runtime — usually
   in production.
2. **They're pure boilerplate.** The interface is just the query restated in
   another syntax. I was typing the same column list twice.

The usual fixes did not fit:

- **ORMs** (Prisma, TypeORM) replace my SQL with their own DSL and runtime — the
  exact thing I was trying to avoid.
- **Codegen tools** (Prisma, `pgtyped`, Kysely-codegen) do give accurate types,
  but they bolt a **generation step** onto the build: a watcher, a CLI, a
  database connection at build time, generated files in version control. More
  moving parts to break in CI.

What I actually wanted was simple: **the query string is already the source of
truth — let the compiler read it.** TypeScript's template literal types are
powerful enough to parse a `SELECT` and map columns to a schema, entirely at
type-check time. So I wrote that. No DSL, no generated files, no build step —
just the SQL I was already writing, now correctly typed.

For a detailed, sourced comparison against Prisma, Kysely, pgTyped, and
Zapatos on build step, runtime cost, bundle size, and DX (not runtime query
speed), see [COMPARISON.md](COMPARISON.md).

## How it works

There is no runtime SQL parser and no build step. The entire parser is written
as recursive [template literal types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/template-literal-types.html)
evaluated by `tsc`:

1. **Normalize** — collapse newlines, tabs, and runs of spaces into a single
   trimmed, single-spaced string.
2. **Parse** — strip the `SELECT` keyword, split on the first case-insensitive
   `FROM`, and separate the column list from the table name.
3. **Resolve** — parse each column into `[outputName, sourceColumn]` (handling
   `AS` aliases and `table.col` qualifiers), then look the column up in your
   schema to get its TypeScript type.
4. **Assemble** — build `{ ...columns }[]`.

The JavaScript that actually ships is a tiny passthrough: it forwards your SQL
to the driver you provide and wraps the rows in a `Result`. All the intelligence
lives in the `.d.ts` types.

## Install

```bash
npm install @owlsql/core
```

`typescript` is a peer dependency (**>= 5.0, < 8** — template literal type
recursion needs 5.0; the ts-plugin does not load on TS 7). You almost
certainly already have it.

The package is **ESM-only** (`import` only — `require()` is not supported).
Node support: **>= 20** for the library and CLI; the `node:sqlite` adapter
and the CLI's SQLite introspection additionally need **Node >= 22.5** (they
fail with a clear error below that).

## Tutorial

### 1. Describe your schema

A schema is just a type: table name → column name → TypeScript type. Use a
`type` or an `interface`, whichever you prefer.

```ts
type DB = {
  users: {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    email: string;
    active: boolean;
  };
  posts: {
    id: number;
    title: string;
    user_id: number;
    published: boolean;
  };
};
```

This type is the single source of truth for what your tables look like. It has
no runtime cost — it is erased during compilation. Mark nullable columns with
`| null` (e.g. `bio: string | null`) and that nullability flows straight into
your query results.

**Optional: generate a starting point with `owlsql generate`.**
Writing that type by hand is fine for a handful of tables, but you can also
have it generated from a real database:

```
npx @owlsql/core generate --url postgres://user:pass@host/db --out schema.ts
```

This connects to your database, introspects the tables/columns/nullability,
and writes a `schema.ts` with `export interface DB { ... }` — the exact shape
from step 1 above. It's a **one-shot generator, not a codegen pipeline**: the
library still parses your queries entirely at the type level with zero
runtime codegen, same as always. The generated file is a normal `.ts` file —
commit it, edit it by hand afterward, rename fields, anything. Running
`generate` again just overwrites it with a fresh snapshot; nothing stays
"synced" automatically — unless you opt into checking for that in CI with
`--check` (below).

| Flag | Required | Description |
| ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `--url` | yes | Connection string (or a file path for SQLite). SQL Server accepts both `mssql://user:pass@host:1433/db` (translated to a driver config; `?encrypt=false` and `?trustServerCertificate=true` supported) and an ADO string (`Server=host;Database=db;User Id=u;Password=p`). |
| `--out` | no | Output file. Defaults to `./schema.ts`. |
| `--dialect` | no | `postgres` \| `mysql` \| `sqlite` \| `mssql`. Auto-detected from the URL scheme (`postgres://`/`postgresql://`, `mysql://`, `mssql://`/`sqlserver://`); an ADO `Server=...` string also routes to `mssql` — falls back to `sqlite` for a bare file path, so it's only needed when that's ambiguous. |
| `--schema` | no | Schema/database name to introspect. Defaults to `public` (Postgres), the connected database (MySQL), or `dbo` (SQL Server). Not used for SQLite. |
| `--table` | no | Comma-separated list (`--table users,posts`). Only introspect these tables, instead of every table in the schema. |
| `--exclude` | no | Comma-separated list. Skip these tables even if `--table` would otherwise include them. |
| `--check` | no | Don't write `--out` — introspect and render as usual, then compare against the existing file. Exits `0` with no output if they match, `1` with a message telling you where they first differ (or that the file doesn't exist yet) if they don't. `--table`/`--exclude`/`--schema` apply identically, so the comparison stays meaningful. Useful in CI to catch a migration that ran without anyone regenerating the committed schema. |

```bash
# CI: fail the build if schema.ts has drifted from the real database
npx @owlsql/core generate --url "$DATABASE_URL" --out schema.ts --check
```

`generate` needs the matching driver installed as a real dependency (`pg`,
`mysql2`, or `mssql` — SQLite uses the `node:sqlite` builtin, Node ≥22.5). It
prints a clear error telling you which one to install if it's missing.

**Type mapping follows each driver's defaults.** `pg` hands back `bigint`,
`numeric`/`decimal` and `money` as `string`; `mysql2` returns `decimal` as
`string` but `bigint` as a JS `number` (unless you enable
`supportBigNumbers`/`bigNumberStrings`); `mssql` (tedious) returns `bigint` as
`string` but parses `decimal`/`numeric`/`money` into JS `number` (with
precision loss beyond 2^53). The generated types mirror exactly that. If your
driver is configured differently, just edit the generated field by hand; it's
a plain type after that point.

### 2. Create a typed client

The library never touches your database. You hand `createTypedDb` an
**executor**: a function that takes `(sql, params)`, runs it against your real
driver, and returns the raw rows.

```ts
import { Pool } from 'pg';
import { createTypedDb } from '@owlsql/core';

const pool = new Pool();

const db = createTypedDb<DB>(async (sql, params) => {
  const res = await pool.query(sql, params as unknown[]);
  return res.rows;
});
```

`db` is now bound to your schema. Every query you run through it will be typed
against `DB`.

### 3. Run queries and handle the Result

`query` does not throw on failure. It returns a **`Result`** — a discriminated
union of success or error — so failures are values you handle explicitly.

```ts
import { ResultStatus } from '@owlsql/core';

const result = await db.query('select id, name from users');

if (result.status === ResultStatus.Error) {
  console.error(result.error.kind, result.error.message);
  return;
}

result.value;
//     ^? { id: number; name: string }[]
for (const user of result.value) {
  console.log(user.id, user.name);
}
```

Prefer a helper over the `status` field? `isOk` / `isErr` narrow the same way:

```ts
import { isOk } from '@owlsql/core';

const result = await db.query('select id, email from users');

if (isOk(result)) {
  result.value;
  //     ^? { id: number; email: string }[]
}
```

> ⚠️ **Pass the SQL as a string literal**, not a `string` variable. If the type
> widens to `string`, the compiler can no longer see the query and inference
> falls back to `unknown`. `db.query('select id from users')` ✅ —
> `const q: string = ...; db.query(q)` ❌.

### 4. Aliases, `*`, and qualified columns

```ts
const renamed = await db.query('select id, name as username from users');
//     renamed.value ^? { id: number; username: string }[]

const implicit = await db.query('select name handle from users');
//     implicit.value ^? { handle: string }[]

const qualified = await db.query('select u.id, u.name from users u');
//     qualified.value ^? { id: number; name: string }[]

const everything = await db.query('select * from users');
//     everything.value ^? { id: number; name: string; email: string; active: boolean }[]
```

Trailing clauses are ignored for inference — they do not change the row shape:

```ts
const recent = await db.query(
  'select id, title from posts where published = true order by id limit 10',
);
//     recent.value ^? { id: number; title: string }[]
```

Keywords are case-insensitive and whitespace/newlines are tolerated, so
formatted multi-line queries work as-is:

```ts
const r = await db.query(`
  SELECT id,
         title
  FROM   posts
  WHERE  published = true
`);
//     r.value ^? { id: number; title: string }[]
```

### 5. Type-only usage (no client)

Sometimes you only want the *type* of a query — for an API contract, a DTO, or a
function signature — without running anything. Use the `Query` type directly:

```ts
import type { Query } from '@owlsql/core';

type UserListRow = Query<DB, 'select id, email from users'>;
//   ^? { id: number; email: string }[]

function renderUsers(rows: Query<DB, 'select id, name from users'>) {
  // rows is { id: number; name: string }[]
}
```

`Row<DB, Q>` gives the single-row object (without the surrounding array) if you
need it.

### 6. Aggregates and functions

Common SQL functions resolve to their return type, and the output column is
named after the function (or its alias):

```ts
const stats = await db.query('select count(*) from users');
//     stats.value ^? { count: number }[]

const named = await db.query('select count(*) as total, max(age) as oldest from users');
//     named.value ^? { total: number; oldest: number }[]

const shout = await db.query('select id, upper(name) as name from users');
//     shout.value ^? { id: number; name: string }[]
```

Recognized: `count`, `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, `length`, `char_length`,
`octet_length`, `abs`, `ceil`, `floor`, `round`, `power`, `mod`, `greatest`,
`least`, `row_number`, `rank`, `dense_rank`, `ntile`, `percent_rank`,
`cume_dist` → `number`; `lower`, `upper`, `trim`, `ltrim`, `rtrim`, `concat` →
`string`; `coalesce`, `nullif`, `lag`, `lead`, `first_value`, `last_value`,
`nth_value` → `unknown`; `now`, `current_timestamp`, `current_date` → `Date`.
Anything else resolves to `unknown`. This return-type table is
dialect-agnostic, which isn't always what the driver actually hands back for
`count`/`sum`/`avg` — see [Limitations](#limitations).

### 7. INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE with RETURNING

`RETURNING` is typed exactly like a `SELECT` projection against the target
table:

```ts
const created = await db.query(
  'insert into users (name, email) values ($1, $2) returning id, name',
);
//     created.value ^? { id: number; name: string }[]

const updated = await db.query('update users set active = $1 where id = $2 returning *');
//     updated.value ^? { id: number; name: string; email: string; active: boolean }[]
```

A write without `RETURNING` resolves to `Record<string, never>[]` (no row
columns).

### 8. Strict mode — turn typos into type errors

By default an unknown column or table resolves to `unknown` (permissive). Pass
`{ strict: true }` and the result instead becomes a `QueryTypeError` carrying a
human-readable message, so a typo is impossible to ignore:

```ts
const db = createTypedDb<DB>(executor, { strict: true });

const ok = await db.query('select id, name from users');
//     ok.value ^? { id: number; name: string }[]

const typo = await db.query('select naem from users');
//     typo.value ^? QueryTypeError<'unknown column: naem'>[]
```

The error type propagates wherever you use the rows, surfacing the message in
hovers and breaking any code that treats them as real data.

### 9. Joins

`INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL` (with optional `OUTER`), and `CROSS` joins are
supported, with table aliases and any number of joins. Qualified columns
(`alias.column`) resolve to the aliased table; unqualified columns are searched
across every joined table. `alias.*` expands one table; a bare `*` expands all.

```ts
const rows = await db.query(
  'select u.name, p.title from users u join posts p on u.id = p.user_id',
);
//     rows.value ^? { name: string; title: string }[]
```

An outer join makes the optional side's columns nullable: `LEFT` nulls the
right-hand table, `RIGHT` nulls the left-hand table, and `FULL` nulls both.

```ts
const rows = await db.query(
  'select u.name, p.title from users u left join posts p on u.id = p.user_id',
);
//     rows.value ^? { name: string; title: string | null }[]
```

`select *` across a join merges the columns of every table (applying join
nullability). In strict mode, an unknown alias becomes
`QueryTypeError<'unknown alias: x'>`.

### 10. Typed parameters

Placeholders in the query are typed from the column they're compared against, so
`query` checks the **number and types** of the arguments you pass:

```ts
await db.query('select id from users where id = $1', 1);
//                                          ^ inferred [number]

await db.query('select id from users where id = $1 and name = $2', 1, 'ada');
//                                                          inferred [number, string]

// @ts-expect-error wrong type — id is a number
await db.query('select id from users where id = $1', 'oops');

// @ts-expect-error wrong count — one param expected
await db.query('select id from users where id = $1');
```

Both numbered (`$1`, `$2`) and positional (`?`) placeholders work, including
across joins (`where p.views > $1` resolves against the aliased table). Use the
`Params<DB, Q>` type to get the tuple on its own.

For this to work, write the comparison **with spaces around the operator**
(`id = $1`, not `id=$1`) — that is what lets the compiler see the column,
operator, and placeholder as separate tokens.

**Placeholder-style checking (opt-in).** The type layer accepts `$n`, `?` and
`@name` interchangeably, but each driver only understands its own style — `?`
with the pg adapter is a runtime syntax error. Declare the style your executor
expects and mismatches become compile errors:

```ts
const db = createTypedDb<DB, { placeholders: 'dollar' }>(createPgExecutor(pool));

// @ts-expect-error '?' is not a pg placeholder — use $1
await db.query('select id from users where id = ?', 1);
```

Styles: `'dollar'` (pg, postgres.js), `'question'` (mysql2), `'at'` (mssql).
`node:sqlite` accepts all three, so leave the option off there.

**Write metadata.** Adapters report driver metadata alongside the rows: on a
successful `Result`, `result.meta?.rowCount` carries the affected-row count
and `result.meta?.lastInsertRowid` the generated id (where the driver
provides one), so an INSERT without `RETURNING` is no longer a black box.

### 11. Transactions

There is a footgun to know about: **never run `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` through an
executor bound to a pool.** Each `query()` may check out a *different*
connection, so `BEGIN` runs on connection A and `COMMIT` on connection B,
leaving an open transaction (and its locks) on a pooled connection that is
later handed to another caller.

`pg`, `postgres.js`, `mysql2`, and `mssql` each ship a small transaction
helper that pins one connection for the whole callback and handles
begin/commit/rollback for you:

```ts
import { Pool } from 'pg';
import { createPgTransaction } from '@owlsql/core/pg';

const pool = new Pool();

async function transferFunds(from: number, to: number, amount: number) {
  await createPgTransaction<DB>(pool)(async (tx) => {
    await tx.query('update accounts set balance = balance - $1 where id = $2', amount, from);
    await tx.query('update accounts set balance = balance + $1 where id = $2', amount, to);
  });
}
```

`createPgTransaction<DB>(pool)` returns the function that actually runs the
transaction — it's curried on `DB` because TypeScript can't partially infer
type arguments; a single `createPgTransaction<DB>(pool, fn)` call would
compile, but would silently stop inferring the callback's return type and
type it `unknown` instead. Splitting `DB` into its own call keeps the second
call (`(fn, options?)`) argument-only, so both the optional `options` and the
callback's return type infer normally.

The callback's `tx` is a full `TypedDb<DB>`, typed exactly like the one
`createTypedDb` returns (pass `{ strict: true }` as the second argument to
the inner call the same way: `createPgTransaction<DB>(pool)(fn, { strict:
true })`). The transaction commits if the callback resolves and rolls back if
it throws — a rejected `tx.query()` result (the normal `Result` error path)
does *not* trigger a rollback by itself, only a thrown error does, same as
everywhere else this library never throws on a query failure.

`createMysql2Transaction<DB>(pool)(fn, options?)` and
`createMssqlTransaction<DB>(pool)(fn, options?)` work the same way.
`createPostgresJsTransaction<DB>(sql)(fn, options?)` wraps postgres.js's own
`sql.begin(...)`, which already pins the connection and handles
commit/rollback itself.

Kysely users should use Kysely's own `db.transaction()`. `node:sqlite` is a
single connection, so plain `begin`/`commit` statements are safe there and no
helper is provided.

Under the hood, each helper does exactly what you'd otherwise write by hand:

```ts
const client = await pool.connect();
const tx = createTypedDb<DB>(createPgExecutor(client), { placeholders: 'dollar' });

try {
  await client.query('begin');
  await tx.query('update accounts set balance = balance - $1 where id = $2', amount, from);
  await tx.query('update accounts set balance = balance + $1 where id = $2', amount, to);
  await client.query('commit');
} catch (error) {
  await client.query('rollback');
  throw error;
} finally {
  client.release();
}
```

## Driver recipes

The executor is the only thing that touches your database, so any driver
works. For the most common drivers, OwlSQL ships a ready-made
adapter — import it from its own subpath and pass your existing client
straight in. No dependency is pulled in unless you import that specific
subpath (each driver is an optional peer dependency).

**node-postgres (`pg`)**

```ts
import { Pool } from 'pg';
import { createPgExecutor } from '@owlsql/core/pg';

const db = createTypedDb<DB>(createPgExecutor(new Pool()));
```

**mysql2**

```ts
import { createPool } from 'mysql2/promise';
import { createMysql2Executor } from '@owlsql/core/mysql2';

const db = createTypedDb<DB>(createMysql2Executor(createPool({ /* ... */ })));
```

**postgres.js**

```ts
import postgres from 'postgres';
import { createPostgresJsExecutor } from '@owlsql/core/postgres';

const db = createTypedDb<DB>(createPostgresJsExecutor(postgres()));
```

**node:sqlite** (Node's built-in SQLite module, no dependency to install — Node ≥22.5)

```ts
import { DatabaseSync } from 'node:sqlite';
import { createNodeSqliteExecutor } from '@owlsql/core/node-sqlite';

const db = createTypedDb<DB>(createNodeSqliteExecutor(new DatabaseSync('app.db')));
```

**better-sqlite3** (synchronous driver wrapped in a promise — no dedicated
adapter, the same one-liner works with `node:sqlite`'s adapter since both
expose `prepare(sql).all(...params)`)

```ts
import Database from 'better-sqlite3';
const sqlite = new Database('app.db');
const db = createTypedDb<DB>(async (sql, params) => sqlite.prepare(sql).all(...params));
```

**Kysely**

```ts
import { Kysely, PostgresDialect } from 'kysely';
import { createKyselyExecutor } from '@owlsql/core/kysely';

const kysely = new Kysely<KyselySchema>({ dialect: new PostgresDialect({ /* ... */ }) });
const db = createTypedDb<DB>(createKyselyExecutor(kysely));
```

The adapter runs your query through `CompiledQuery.raw`, which forwards the
SQL text and parameters straight to the underlying driver with **no
placeholder translation** — the SQL you write still has to use whichever
placeholder syntax your configured dialect's own driver expects (`$1` for
`PostgresDialect`, `?` for `MysqlDialect`/`SqliteDialect`). What the adapter
does *not* care about is which Kysely dialect object you passed in; it just
relays whatever string you give it.

If you want the same compile-time protection against using the wrong
placeholder style that the other adapters get, pass `placeholders` to
`createTypedDb` the same way you would for any of them — it's driven by
that option, not by which adapter produced the executor:

```ts
const db = createTypedDb<DB, { placeholders: 'question' }>(createKyselyExecutor(kysely));
```

**Drizzle (raw SQL)**

Drizzle's own `sql.raw()` doesn't take a separate parameters array, so it
can't be wired directly into an `Executor`. Instead, reach through Drizzle to
the underlying driver client with [`db.$client`](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/connect-overview)
and reuse the matching adapter above — one extra line over the plain driver:

```ts
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/node-postgres';
import { createPgExecutor } from '@owlsql/core/pg';

const drizzleDb = drizzle(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);
const db = createTypedDb<DB>(createPgExecutor(drizzleDb.$client));
```

Swap `createPgExecutor` for `createMysql2Executor`/`createPostgresJsExecutor`/
`createNodeSqliteExecutor` depending on which Drizzle driver you're using —
`$client` is always the native driver instance underneath.

**mssql (SQL Server)**

```ts
import sql from 'mssql';
import { createMssqlExecutor } from '@owlsql/core/mssql';

const pool = await sql.connect({ /* ... */ });
const db = createTypedDb<DB>(createMssqlExecutor(pool));
```

The adapter scans the query for `@name` placeholders (skipping string
literals and `@@` system variables) and binds each one by name via
`request.input(...)`, in order of first appearance — matching how
`Params<DB, Q>` types the positional tuple. A repeated `@name` binds once.

## Database support

The parser accepts the SQL used by each of the four major engines, without any
per-dialect configuration — it stays permissive and recognizes each dialect's
syntax by shape, not by a declared "mode".

| Feature | PostgreSQL | MySQL | SQLite | SQL Server |

## Editor autocomplete

```ts
db.query(`
  select id, na
`)
//              ^ autocomplete suggests `name`

db.query(`select id, name from users`)
//                    ^ hovering shows (column) name: string

db.query(`select id from users where na`)
//                                    ^ autocomplete suggests `name`
```

Want to see it running for yourself before there's a recorded demo here?
[`examples/ts-plugin-demo`](examples/ts-plugin-demo) is a ready-to-open
VSCode project set up for exactly that.

`@owlsql/core/ts-plugin` is a **TypeScript Language Service Plugin** —
it runs inside `tsserver`, the same process that already powers VSCode's
IntelliSense, and adds column-name completions while you're still typing the
query string. This is a genuinely different mechanism from the rest of the
library: everything else works by *type-checking* a finished query string;
this works by hooking into the editor's completion request for a string
that isn't even valid SQL yet.

**Setup** — add it to your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "plugins": [{ "name": "@owlsql/core/ts-plugin" }]
  }
}
```

Then, in VSCode, open the Command Palette and run **"TypeScript: Select
TypeScript Version" → "Use Workspace Version"**. This step is not optional —
VSCode's *bundled* TypeScript does not load workspace plugins, so skipping it
is the #1 reason this kind of plugin appears to do nothing. Other editors
that talk to `tsserver` (Cursor, some Neovim/Sublime LSP setups) generally
pick up `tsconfig.json` plugins automatically.

**What it does:** suggests column names right after `SELECT`/a comma in the
column list or after `WHERE`/`AND`/`OR`, suggests table names right after
`FROM`/`JOIN` (or a comma in an old-style comma-joined `FROM` list), and
shows a column's resolved type on hover, for `db.query(...)` calls made
through a client built with `createTypedDb<DB>`. It is `JOIN`/alias-aware:
every table introduced by a `FROM` or `JOIN` in the same string is in scope,
and typing an alias qualifier (`u.` in `... from users u`) narrows
completions and hover to that one source. With no qualifier, completions/hover
union columns across all sources present so far — the deduplicated union of
every table in `DB` before any `FROM` is typed at all, exactly what covers
the example above. `WHERE`-position completions require a `FROM` to already
be present (there's no table to scope to otherwise); table-name completions
after `FROM`/`JOIN` suggest every table in `DB`, filtered by whatever prefix
you've typed. It also reports unknown columns, unknown tables, unknown
aliases, and ambiguous unqualified columns (present in more than one joined
table) as live editor diagnostics in the `SELECT` list, `FROM`/`JOIN` clause,
and simple `WHERE` comparisons (`where naem = 'x'` squiggles `naem` the
moment you type it) — the same checks strict mode (`{ strict: true }`)
applies at compile time, surfaced as a squiggle while you type instead of
only once the query is finished.

**What it does not do** (documented scope, not bugs):

- **`WHERE`-clause diagnostics cover simple comparisons only.** A column
  token immediately before `=`/`<>`/`<`/`>`/`<=`/`>=`/`LIKE`/`ILIKE`/`IN`/
  `BETWEEN`/`IS`, or `AND`/`OR`, or the end of the clause, is checked exactly
  like a `SELECT`-list column. The moment a `WHERE` clause contains any `(`
  or `)` at all — a subquery, a function call, a parenthesized group — the
  whole clause is skipped rather than risked: no diagnostics for it, never a
  wrong one. `HAVING`/`ORDER BY`/`GROUP BY` aren't checked at all.
- The first `FROM <table>` is found with a regex, not a real SQL parser: a
  `FROM (subquery)` can make it lock onto a table name from inside the
  subquery instead of recognizing there's no real outer table yet.
- Only plain string/template literals with **no interpolation**
  (`` db.query(`select ...`) ``) are recognized — which is the only form the
  library ever expects you to write, since parameters are SQL placeholders
  (`$1`/`?`/`@name`), never JS template interpolation. Interpolating
  (`` db.query(`select ... ${x}`) ``) silently turns completions/hover off
  for that call — there's no squiggle or warning telling you why.
- Completions after `ORDER BY`/`GROUP BY`/`HAVING`/etc. aren't offered yet —
  only the `SELECT` column list, `WHERE` clause, and `FROM`/`JOIN` table
  names.
- **Requires TypeScript < 7.** TypeScript 7's native (Go-based) compiler
  removed the classic JS Compiler API (`ts.Node`, `ts.forEachChild`,
  `ts.createProgram`, ...) that this plugin — and, as of this writing, every
  TypeScript language service plugin in the ecosystem — is built on. There is
  no compatibility shim yet. The plugin works on TypeScript 5.x/6.x; on 7.x
  it currently fails to load rather than silently doing nothing.

**`query` return type.** `query` resolves to
`Result<Query<DB, Q>, QueryError>`. On success, `result.value` holds the typed
rows. On failure, `result.error` is a `QueryError`:

- `EMPTY_QUERY` — the SQL string was empty/whitespace (guarded before the
  executor runs).
- `EXECUTOR_FAILED` — your executor threw; the original error is on
  `error.cause`.

**Optional: `defineSchema`.** An identity helper that returns its argument
typed as a `Schema`, for the rare case where you keep a runtime schema object
and want it validated against the expected shape. The schema is purely
type-level, so **most projects just write `type DB = { ... }` and never need
this.**

## Supported SQL subset

| Feature | Example |
| ------- | ------- |
| Column projection | `select id, name from users` |
| `SELECT *` | `select * from users` |
| Explicit alias | `select name as username from users` |
| Implicit alias | `select name username from users` |
| Qualified columns | `select u.id, u.name from users u` |
| Case-insensitive keywords | `SELECT id FROM users` |
| Newlines / messy whitespace | multi-line queries are normalized |
| Trailing clauses (ignored) | `... where active = true order by id limit 10` |
| Aggregates / functions | `select count(*) as total, lower(name) from users` |
| `RETURNING` | `insert into users (name) values ($1) returning id` |
| Nullable columns | `bio: string \| null` → `{ bio: string \| null }` |
| Joins | `select u.name, p.title from users u join posts p on u.id = p.user_id` |
| `LEFT`/`RIGHT`/`FULL` nullability | outer-joined side(s) become `T \| null` |
| Qualified / mixed star | `select u.*, p.title from ...`, `select *, extra from ...` |
| Quoted / schema-qualified ids | `select "id" from public."users"` |
| Trailing semicolon | `select id from users;` |
| Typed parameters | `where id = $1` → `query(sql, id: number)` |

| `MERGE ... OUTPUT` | `merge into t as target using ... on ... when matched then ... output inserted.id, $action` (SQL Server) — see [Limitations](#limitations) |

## Limitations

This is a focused tool for the common read path, not a full SQL grammar:

- **Scalar subqueries in the `SELECT` list are typed for the simple case** —
  a single-column, non-nested subquery (`select (select count(*) from posts
  where posts.user_id = users.id) as post_count from users`) resolves to
  that column's type, with `| null` added since a scalar subquery yields
  NULL on zero rows (`count(...)` subqueries are exempt — they always
  return a row). A subquery selecting more than one column resolves to
  `unknown` in normal mode (rather than picking one arbitrarily) and to a
  `QueryTypeError` in strict mode, since selecting more than one column
  from a scalar subquery is invalid SQL. Subqueries used as a value inside
  `WHERE` are not typed at all (`WHERE` isn't part of the typed structure —
  only scanned for parameter placeholders).
- **Nested `CASE` is supported** — a `CASE` expression inside another
  `CASE`'s `WHEN`/`THEN`/`ELSE` branch is parsed and typed like any other
  branch expression.
- **Window `OVER (...)` clauses are only used as a boundary**, not parsed for
  their own typing — `PARTITION BY`/`ORDER BY` content inside `OVER (...)` is
  discarded, not validated.
- **Aggregates assume numeric output, dialect-agnostically.** `min`/`max`
  resolve to `number` even over a text column; unrecognized functions resolve
  to `unknown`. `count`, `sum`, and `avg` also resolve to `number`, but that's
  not always what comes back at runtime: with `pg`'s default config (no
  custom `types` parser), `count(*)`/`count(col)` is `bigint` and
  `sum(int_col)`/`avg(...)` is `numeric` at the SQL level, and `pg` decodes
  both as JS strings to avoid precision loss — the same reason plain
  `bigint`/`numeric` *columns* map to `string` (see [Type mapping follows
  each driver's defaults](#1-describe-your-schema)). Cast at the call site
  (`Number(rows[0].count)`, or a BigInt-aware conversion) if you need to do
  arithmetic on it. `lag`, `lead`, `first_value`, `last_value`, `nth_value`
  resolve to `unknown` (their real type depends on the argument, which isn't
  inspected).
- **`select *` across a join merges columns by name.** When two tables share a
  column name (e.g. both have `id`), the types are intersected rather than kept
  separate. Alias the columns to keep them distinct.
- **Typed parameters need spaced operators.** `where id = $1` is typed;
  `where id=$1` is not. `INSERT ... VALUES` parameters are matched
  positionally against the INSERT's column list — `insert into t (a, b)
  values ($1, $2)` types `$1`/`$2` as `a`/`b`; without an explicit column
  list they fall back to a flexible `unknown[]`. Placeholders inside a
  `WITH` CTE's own body are typed against that CTE's own `FROM` source (and
  earlier CTEs it references), in the same textual order they appear in the
  query, ahead of placeholders in the outer query that follows the `WITH`
  clause. Numbered placeholders bind by
  their index (`$2` fills the second tuple slot even when it appears first);
  a repeated `$n` occupies a single slot.
- **Quoted identifiers** use `"..."` (standard), `[...]` (SQL Server), or
  `` `...` `` (MySQL — escape the backtick with `\`` inside the template
  literal). Schema-qualified tables (`public.users`) resolve by their final
  segment (`users`).
- **`TOP` supports a plain count, `TOP N PERCENT`, `TOP N WITH TIES`, and
  `TOP N PERCENT WITH TIES`** (`PERCENT` before `WITH TIES`, the only order
  T-SQL accepts) — none of
  these affect the inferred row shape, same as `LIMIT`/`OFFSET`. `OUTPUT`
  only recognizes the `inserted`/`deleted` pseudo-table prefixes (they
  resolve against the statement's single table); `OUTPUT ... INTO @table` is
  not supported.
- **`MERGE` types the target table and `OUTPUT` clause, not the merge logic
  itself.** The `USING`/`ON`/`WHEN MATCHED`/`WHEN NOT MATCHED` branches aren't
  parsed or validated — only `MERGE INTO <target>` (an explicit `INTO` is
  required; the rarely-used `MERGE <target> USING ...` form without it isn't
  recognized) and the trailing `OUTPUT` clause, resolved against the target
  table the same way `OUTPUT` already works for `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`.
  `OUTPUT $action` is recognized and typed as `'INSERT' | 'UPDATE' |
  'DELETE'`.
- **Unknown columns, tables, or aliases resolve to `unknown`** by default — pass
  `{ strict: true }` to turn them into a `QueryTypeError` instead.

These are deliberate scope choices; the [FAQ](#faq) covers how to work around
them.

## FAQ

**Does this run SQL or connect to a database?** No. It only types the result.
You supply the executor that talks to your driver.

**Is there a build step or codegen?** No. The types are computed by `tsc` during
your normal type check. Nothing is generated and nothing is written to disk.

**My result is typed `unknown[]`.** The query was likely passed as a `string`
variable instead of a string literal, or it selects a column/table not in your
schema. Inline the literal and check the schema.

**How do I handle a `JOIN`?** `JOIN` is inferred natively — see
[section 9](#9-joins). `INNER`/`LEFT`/`RIGHT`/`FULL`/`CROSS` are all
supported, including nullability of the outer-joined side.

**Why a `Result` instead of throwing?** Database calls are expected to fail
sometimes; modelling that as a value (rather than an exception) forces callers
to handle it and keeps error handling explicit and type-checked.
